    <a href="index.html">INDEX.45 <a>is a visual journey created during the transition between Brooklyn Heights and Printed Matter–a book store located in the Chelsea art district. It is a journey, not a destination. It has a destination, yes. But there are many interesting routes to travel and many ways to reach our goals.

				Mapping the routes of our lives, I would call it. Especially in times like now, where the pandemic is forcing us to be flexible and patient, where we have to re-think and re-schedule, I think the best thing we can do is to just step back and enjoy the view during the journey. Times like this are good to reflect.</a></a>
